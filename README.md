# HolyGL (Previously Gr2)
A divinely inspired realtime graphics library for the TempleOS distro [ZenithOS](https://github.com/ZenithOS/ZenithOS).
It aims to stay true to Terry's objectives by being simple, easy to understand, and transparent.

# Features in Development
* SSE/AVX accelerated math library.
* Multicore rendering.
* New software renderering pipeline for real time games.

# Features Implemented
* Half-Life WAD texture loading.
* BMP texture loading and saving.
* Draw library for 2D primitives.
* Software rasterizer with custom shader support.
    * currently being rewritten, you can use an older commit if you would like to experiment with this (the new renderer will have the same user interface).

# Installation
This library can be compiled by your project or by the operating system on boot. Compiling the
library at boot is useful because it provides syntax highlighting for the library.

The library can be compiled by including `MakeHolyGL.CC`, found in the root of the library. To compile on boot, append `#include "Path/To/MakeHolyGL"` to the end of `Zenith/MakeZenith.CC` If you are a developer though, it is recommended that you comment out #includes in the makefile for math files
that use assembly, as the OS will not let you compile an assembly "function" if it was already compiled
earlier.

# Documentation
This library uses more verbose function/class documentation than standard TempleOS function comments. The autogenerated HTML Doxygen documentation is in `docs/`, and viewable [here](https://templeprogramming.github.io/HolyGL/).

DolDoc documentation with sprite diagrams is available in `HolyGL/Docs`.
