# CosmicGL (Previously Gr2)
A divinely inspired realtime graphics library for the TempleOS distro [ZenithOS](https://github.com/ZenithOS/ZenithOS).
It aims to stay true to Terry's objectives by being simple, easy to understand, and transparent.

This library has now been integrated into [ZenithOS](https://github.com/ZenithOS/ZenithOS). It is located in
[Zenith/CosmicGL](https://github.com/ZenithOS/ZenithOS/tree/master/src/Zenith/CosmicGL), and the demos are in
[Home/CosmicGLDemos](https://github.com/ZenithOS/ZenithOS/tree/master/src/Home/CosmicGLDemos).

The library uses more verbose function/class documentation than standard TempleOS function comments. The autogenerated
HTML Doxygen documentation is in `docs/`, and viewable [here](https://templeprogramming.github.io/CosmicGL/).
DolDoc documentation with diagrams is available in 
[Zenith/CosmicGL/Docs](https://github.com/ZenithOS/ZenithOS/tree/master/src/Zenith/CosmicGL/Docs).
